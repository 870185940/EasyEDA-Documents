# PCB Order 
  After laying out your PCB, you probably want to order some **PCBs**. We have made it easy for you to save time and money by using our **awesome service** to order **low cost**, **high quality** PCBs *directly* from EasyEDA. More importantly, if you are not satisfied with the quality of our PCBs, EasyEDA will refund your money in full.

  Although EasyEDA makes it easy to order PCBs for your projects and offers an exceptionally low PCB Manufacturing fee, you are free to download the Gerber files and order your PCBs from any other vendor. However, if you like EasyEDA, please give us a chance to fab. the PCB for you. We think you won't be disappointed.


## PCB Quality
   As engineers, we have spent more than 5 years building EasyEDA. As artisans, we believe that if you like using our EDA tools, then you will like our PCBs. 

   EasyEDA's PCB are in a group buy model and all PCBs are given 100% E-test This allows us to provide you with good quality, tested PCBs at a great price. We have shipped thousands to our users, all of whom like our PCBs. 

 No matter how good we tell you our service is, maybe you still have doubts. The easy way to remove those doubts is to try it out because - as we have said above - if you are not satisfied with the quality of our PCBs, we will refund your money in full. For details of this offer, please check the [Warranty and Return](#WarrantyandReturn).
 

## Order Button
To order PCBs from us, just click the **Fabrication Output...** button, like image below, and you will be redirected to an order page. In that page you can place an order quickly and easily. At the same time, you can download your Gerber and drill files (and open them in a 3rd party Gerber Viewer to check them!). Honestly, we hope that you will support EasyEDA by ordering your PCBs from us but you are welcome to download the Gerber and drill files and send them to your favorite PCB house.

## PCB Order from EasyEDA Editor
   When you click the `Fabrication Output...` button your order is coming from within the EasyEDA editor environment so you don't need to input information about **Layers**, **Width** and **Height**; EasyEDA fills this information in for you. 
   
   On the order form page you will find a real time price. Most of the time this price is the final cost however if, for example, you change the Layers to 4 or 6, you will find the price field changes to **Quote**. If that happens, don't worry: just click the `Save to Cart` button and we will email a quote for the final price for you ASAP. 

 **Note.** When you add your PCB to the cart, EasyEDA saves a copy of Gerber files *at that time*. If you then change your PCB back in then PCB editor, *EasyEDA does not synchronize your Gerber files to the updated PCB design*. The only way is to delete the earlier version of the PCB from your Cart and then add the updated design as a new item.
