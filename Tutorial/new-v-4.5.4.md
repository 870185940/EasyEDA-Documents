This tool is used to cross probe from  chosen objects on the current schematic  to its corresponding counterparts in the PCB, or from PCB Footprints to corresponding  counterparts in the schematic. 
 
Note, you need to open the schematics and PCB.  Don't forget to use hotkey `SHIFT+X`

## Board outline wizard

  Some users want to set  very precision board outlines, now we can do in this way. Open your PCB, find the menu via toolbar.

In this dialog, we provide 3 type board outline setting, Rectangular , Circular, Round Rect.
If you need other complex board outline, you can import a DXF file.
