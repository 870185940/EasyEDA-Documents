## EasyEDA ambitions in 2017
**1. Provide components order with your PCB.**
   We will ship the component with your PCB, so for lots of common components, you can order from us, no need to buy from digikey or mouser. you will save lots of time and money. w

**2. Provide PCB assembly service.**
  EasyEDA always provides PCB assembly service, just a few customers who chat via email know that. In 2017, we will make this service public. So after you design the PCB, we will help you to sourcing the components and assembly them. You just need to focus the design and debug.

##New EasyEDA libs
 Form this version, EasyEDA libs try to help you to convert to PCB easier and order components easier.  For Resistor, Capacitor, Inductor EasyEDA provides the components with package selection and  provides ** US styles** and **IEC styles**
