# Custom modelling

This is an advanced topic and this section will be filled out when time permits.

However, browsing through some of the EasyEDA in-house models can be informative because, although they do not come with a 'How it works' written into them, there is some documentation in their .subckt definitions that may give some insights into the wild and wonderful world of custom modelling.

Some examples to look through the netlists of are:
