There are no abosulte free bussiness models, EasyEDA should support the team too.

Trying to provide a disruptive innovation, we provide a great free web based EDA tool, but we try to make money from other services, such as provide PCB order, PCB assembly,advertising and special project review by our professional electronics engineers.

Feel free to use EasyEDA, we promise EasyEDAs' core features are absolutely free to every one.

## FAQ

### Can I change my plan at any time?

Yes, Now Every one can enjoy the free Professional plan.</dd>

### EDA tools are quite expensive to build, Why you can free the core features?
Yes, more that 5 years to build EasyEDA and will spent another X years. 

We will be unique, we will make money from services, maybe some time you would like to donate or give us some tip :)

### Do you offer special nonprofit and educational pricing?
We think the free Standard plan is enough, if you need more, just email to us.

### Will we be prevented to download the Gerber and drill files?
Never like some desktop free EDA, you just can order PCB from them. We hope you can order PCB from us, but you are welcome to use the other PCB house. EasyEDA file format is open source, you can the gerber files in your own codes, and we will open source our gerber produces program soon, may be you can improve it.

### What will happen when my private projects more than 2 in Standard plan.
The easy way is upgrade to Professional, and you can make the private projects to public, or back the private projects to locally and remove them from your accout.

But you can get more via 
>   1. Contibute awesome public projects, If we feature your one public project, you will get one more private project.
>   2. Create Nice symbols and Footprints. Every 15 nice componts will be reward a private projects.
>   3. Invite your friends to EasyEDA, Every two join will be reward a private projects.
>   4. more coming soon.

### What about the terrible Advertisement?
We hate terrible advertisement also, this is why you can't see any Ads in the clean EasyEDA. But some time, if we can find some tasteful Ads, you can get lots of knowlage from them.

Maybe EasyEDA will be advertisement free forever.

### Why the Cloud Auto router is unkown?
The supper fast Auto router will cost lots of CPU resource, we will to evaluate this, and this function is under development. But we can confirm almost all of the greate hardward projects are manually router.
